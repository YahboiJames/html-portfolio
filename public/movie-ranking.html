<h1>James' Top 3 Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>Here I will rank my top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Scott Pilgrim Vs The World</h3>
<P>My favourite movie off all time is the cinematic adapatation of the scott pilgrim comics, directed by Edgar Wright
    this movie is a homage to the strugles of real people in a fantasy world and the fact that just because you are the hero 
    doesnt mean your a good guy.
</P>
<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>A Tim Burton classic, the nightmare before chirstmas is a tale of discovery and spirit for doing the right thing, a stop motion animation
    that has aged well for its time this holiday movie can be enjoyed by all.
</p>
<h3>Hot Fuzz</h3>
<p>Another Edgar Wright film, the second in the cornetto trilogy this british comedy takes us through a police department in a rural village 
    uncovering a killer amongst them. A film for many laughs and quotible lines another master piece and must watch.
